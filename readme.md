> Fan control for ASUS devices running Linux.

In default, some ASUS devices running Linux control their system fans inappropriately. **Typical symptoms** include:

* Running fans even when not under any load
* Not running fans under load appropriately
* Spinning up fans in short performance peaks

Asus-fan-control solves the problems above and even more. It is also very easy to understand as it communicates with hardware exclusively using ACPI calls. **Tested devices** with links to their first testers:

## Install

### Dependencies

* **systemd** suite
* **acpi_call** module (see below)
* **dmidecode** tool (see below)

### Using GitPack

Asus-fan-control supports [GitPack](https://github.com/dominiksalvet/gitpack). Global installation/update:

```sh
sudo gitpack install github.com/dominiksalvet/asus-fan-control
```

> If your system has APT, GitPack will install acpi_call and dmidecode automatically.

### From AUR

If you are using Arch Linux or an Arch-based distribution, there is an [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/asus-fan-control) available. Just [install](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_packages) asus-fan-control from AUR. It may be a good idea to also enable running asus-fan-control automatically:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable asus-fan-control
```

## Usage

Asus-fan-control is **executed automatically whenever necessary** to keep the effect of a permanent change. Nevertheless, it is possible to invoke it manually as shown below:

```sh
sudo asus-fan-control
```

> It uses custom temperatures if previously set, otherwise the default temperatures are used.

### Custom temperatures

The fan speed policy is usually defined by 8 increasing numbers representing temperature boundaries in degrees Celsius between individual fan speed levels. E.g., UX430UA's default temperatures are `55 60 62 65 68 72 76 80` as shown:

| Speed level | Temperature (CÂ°) |
|-------------|------------------|
| 0 (off)     | 54 and less      |
| 1           | 55 to 59         |
| 2           | 60 to 61         |
| 3           | 62 to 64         |
| 4           | 65 to 67         |
| 5           | 68 to 71         |
| 6           | 72 to 75         |
| 7           | 76 to 79         |
| 8 (max)     | 80 and more      |

To use your custom temperatures, use the `set-temps` command. For example:

```sh
sudo asus-fan-control set-temps 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80
```

### GUI
